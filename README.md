# NN_Sem_Category
Semantic Category Neural Network

  The files in this repository include various steps taken toward using image categorization to study semantic categorization of living and nonliving things. As an introduction to using Python, TensorFlow and Jupyter Notebook, this repository starts with very simple models, including a basic binary model that categorizes some images between living and nonliving things. There are also multicategory models working with more specific semantic category labels. A neural network with multiclass labeling that analyzes images to identify both a broader category label of living and nonliving, but also  more specific labels (i.e. living and bird or nonliving and car) can be found [here](https://github.com/kderderian/NN_Sem_Category/blob/master/multilabel_living_and_nonliving.csv).
